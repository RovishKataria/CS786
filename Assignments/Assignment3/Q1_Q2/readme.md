### Instructions for Running the Program

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - I used the conda environment specifications provided by the course. Make sure to use the modified `environment.yml` file included in this repository.
   - Deactivate any existing environments and activate the new environment created from `environment.yml` to ensure the required packages are installed.

2. **Data Generation**:
   - The script `createImage.py` has been modified to produce images of size 299x299 pixels and to resolve some debugging issues.
   - To generate the dataset for the global symmetry task, run `generate_data.py`. This will create training, testing, and validation datasets.
   - **Note**: If you want to skip the data generation step, a pre-generated dataset (`data.zip`) has been provided in the repository. You can extract the zip file to avoid running the data generation scripts.

3. **Optional Step: Data Management**:
   - If you decide to run the data generation scripts, only the required datasets (train, test, and validation) will be generated. The `train_break`, `test_break`, and `valid_break` datasets have been omitted for efficiency and debugging purposes.
   - After generating the data, rename the folder structure from `data/symmetry_global/ds1` to `data` for consistency.

4. **Running Q1 and Q2**:
   - Once the dataset is ready, execute the script `Q1_Q2.py` by passing the path to the data directory as an argument:
     ```
     python3 Q1_Q2.py data
     ```
   - This will run the code for both Q1 and Q2, using the dataset located in the specified directory.

### Inception V4 Implementation

- The implementation of Inception V4 was based on the original paper, and the code was adapted from the following repository: [Inception V4 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kentsommer/keras-inceptionV4/blob/ef1db6f09b6511779c05fab47d374741bc89b5ee/inception_v4.py#L242).
- I updated the `train_incep3.py` file, which originally used Inception V3, to utilize Inception V4. This required modifying the script to accommodate the architecture of Inception V4.

### Important Changes and Notes

- The original images generated by `createImage.py` were 200x200 pixels, which resulted in shape mismatch errors during training with Inception V4. To address this, I adjusted the image size to 299x299 pixels, which is compatible with the Inception V4 model.
- The code has been tested and verified with these changes. The screenshot of the training process for Inception V4 is attached.
